        This document is a preliminary draft of a specification for the
        Selection API and selection related functionality. It replaces a couple
        of old sections of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML
        specification</a>, the selection part of the old <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range-20001113/ranges.html">
        DOM Range specification</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document defines APIs for selection, which allows users and
        authors to select a portion of a document or specify a point of
        interest for copy, paste, and other editing operations.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        This is work in progress.

        Background
      </h2>
      <p>
        IE9 and Firefox 6.0a2 allow arbitrary ranges in the selection, which
        follows what this spec originally said. However, this leads to
        unpleasant corner cases that authors, implementers, and spec writers
        all have to deal with, and they don't make any real sense. Chrome 14
        dev and Opera 11.11 aggressively normalize selections, like not letting
        them lie inside empty elements and things like that, but this is also
        viewed as a bad idea, because it takes flexibility away from authors.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I changed the spec to a made-up compromise that allows some
        simplification but doesn't constrain authors much. See <a href=
        "https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2011Jun/0193.html">
        discussion</a>. Basically it would throw exceptions in some places to
        try to stop the selection from containing a range that had a
        <a>boundary point</a> other than an Element or Text node, or a boundary
        point that didn't descend from a Document.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this meant getRangeAt() had to start returning a copy, not a
        reference. Also, it would be prone to things failing weirdly in corner
        cases. Perhaps most significantly, all sorts of problems might arise
        when DOM mutations transpire, like if a boundary point's node is
        removed from its parent and the mutation rules would place the new
        boundary point inside a non-Text/Element node. And finally, the
        previously-specified behavior had the advantage of matching two major
        implementations, while the new behavior matched no one. So I changed it
        back.

        Definition
      </h2>
      <p>
        Every <a>document</a> with a [=Document/browsing context=] has a unique
        <dfn>selection</dfn> associated with it.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        This is a requirement of the HTML spec. IE9 and Opera Next 12.00 alpha
        seem to follow it, while Firefox 12.0a1 and Chrome 17 dev seem not to.
        See <a href=
        "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=717339">Mozilla bug</a>,
        <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76114">WebKit bug</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This one <a>selection</a> must be shared by all the content of the
        <a>document</a> (though not by nested <a>documents</a>), including any
        [=editing hosts=] in the document. [=Editing hosts=] that are not
        inside a <a>document</a> cannot have a <a>selection</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <a>selection</a> can be associated with a single <a>range</a>.
        When there is no <a>range</a> associated with the <a>selection</a>, the
        selection is <dfn>empty</dfn>. The selection must be initially
        <a>empty</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        A <a>document</a>'s <a>selection</a> is a singleton object associated
        with that <a>document</a>, so it gets replaced with a new object when
        <code>Document.open()</code> is called. See <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=15470">bug 15470</a>.
        IE9 and Opera Next 12.00 alpha allow the user to reset the range to
        null after the fact by clicking somewhere; Firefox 12.0a1 and Chrome 17
        dev do not. We follow Gecko/WebKit, because it lessens the chance of
        getRangeAt(0) throwing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a <a>selection</a> is associated with a given <a>range</a>, it
        must continue to be associated with that same <a>range</a> until this
        specification requires otherwise.
      </p>
      <p class="note" data-link-for="Selection">
        For instance, if the DOM changes in a way that changes the range's
        boundary points, or a script modifies the boundary points of the range,
        the same range object must continue to be associated with the
        selection. However, if the user changes the selection or a script calls
        {{addRange()}}, the selection must be associated with a new range
        object, as required elsewhere in this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the <a>selection</a>'s <a>range</a> is not null and is
        [=range/collapsed=], then the caret position must be at that
        <a>range</a>'s <a>boundary point</a>. When the <a>selection</a> is not
        empty, this specification does not define the caret position; user
        agents should follow platform conventions in deciding whether the caret
        is at the start of the <a>selection</a>, the end of the
        <a>selection</a>, or somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        This short-changes Mac users. See <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=13909">bug 13909</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <a>selection</a> has a <dfn>direction</dfn>, <dfn>forwards</dfn>,
        <dfn>backwards</dfn>, or <dfn>directionless</dfn>. If the user creates
        a <a>selection</a> by indicating first one <a>boundary point</a> of the
        <a>range</a> and then the other (such as by clicking on one point and
        dragging to another), and the first indicated <a>boundary point</a> is
        [=boundary point/after=] the second, then the corresponding
        <a>selection</a> must initially be <a>backwards</a>. If the first
        indicated <a>boundary point</a> is [=boundary point/before=] the
        second, then the corresponding <a>selection</a> must initially be
        <a>forwards</a>. Otherwise, it must be <a>directionless</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <a>selection</a>s also have an <dfn>anchor</dfn> and a
        <dfn>focus</dfn>. If the <a>selection</a>'s <a>range</a> is null, its
        <a>anchor</a> and <a>focus</a> are both null. If the <a>selection</a>'s
        <a>range</a> is not null and its <a>direction</a> is <a>forwards</a>,
        its <a>anchor</a> is the <a>range</a>'s [=range/start=], and its
        <a>focus</a> is the [=range/end=]. Otherwise, its <a>focus</a> is the
        [=range/start=] and its <a>anchor</a> is the [=range/end=].

              Based mostly on Firefox 9.0a2. It has a bug that I didn't
              reproduce, namely that if you pass a Document as the argument,
              the end offset becomes 1 instead of the number of children it
              has. It also throws a RangeException instead of DOMException,
              because its implementation predated their merging.
            </p>
            <p>
              IE9 behaves similarly but with glitches. It throws "Unspecified
              error." if the node is detached or display:none, and apparently
              in some random other cases too. It throws "Invalid argument." for
              detached comments (only!). Finally, if you pass it a comment, it
              seems to select the whole comment, unlike with text nodes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chrome 16 dev behaves as you'd expect given its Selection
              implementation. It refuses to select anything that's not visible,
              so it's almost always wrong. Opera 11.50 just does nothing in all
              my tests, as usual.

              12.00 alpha can't be tested, because getRangeAt() returns a copy

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Originally, the Selection interface was a Netscape feature. The
          original implementation was carried on into Gecko (Firefox), and the
          feature was later implemented independently by other browser engines.
          The Netscape implementation always allowed multiple ranges in a
          single selection, for instance so the user could select a column of a
          table However, multi-range selections proved to be an unpleasant
          corner case that web developers didn't know about and even Gecko
          developers rarely handled correctly. Other browser engines never
          implemented the feature, and clamped selections to a single range in
          various incompatible fashions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification follows non-Gecko engines in restricting
          selections to at most one range, but the API was still originally
          designed for selections with arbitrary numbers of ranges. This
          explains oddities like the coexistence of <code>removeRange()</code>
          and <code>removeAllRanges()</code>, and a <code>getRangeAt()</code>
          method that takes an integer argument that must always be zero.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        All of the members of the {{Selection}} interface are defined in terms
        of operations on the <code><a>range</a></code> object (if any)
        represented by the object. These operations can raise exceptions, as
        defined for the {{Range}} interface; this can therefore result in the
        members of the <a>Selection</a> interface raising exceptions as well,
        in addition to any explicitly called out below.

        <a>range</a> (not modify the existing <a>range</a>), and set update
        <a>selection</a>'s <a>direction</a> to <a>forwards</a> if the
        [=range/start=] is [=boundary point/before=] or equal to the
        [=range/end=], <a>backwards</a> if if the [=range/end=] is [=boundary
        point/before=] the [=range/start=], or <a>directionless</a> if the
        [=range/start=] and the [=range/end=] cannot be ordered due to the
        platform convention.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent must not make a <a>selection</a> <a>empty</a> if it was
        not already <a>empty</a> in response to any user actions (e.g. clicking
        on a non-editable region).

      <p class="note">
        See <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=15470">bug
        15470</a>. IE9 and Opera Next 12.00 alpha allow the user to reset the
        range to null after the fact by clicking somewhere; Firefox 12.0a1 and
        Chrome 17 dev do not. I follow Gecko/WebKit, because it lessens the
        chance of getRangeAt(0) throwing.

          <code><dfn>selectstart</dfn></code> event
        </h3>
        <p>
          When the user agent is about to associate a new range
          <var>newRange</var> to the <a>selection</a> in response to a user
          initiated action, the user agent must <a>fire an event</a> with the
          name <code>selectstart</code>, which bubbles and is cancelable, at
          the [=boundary point/node=] associated with the <a>boundary point</a>
          of <var>newRange</var>'s [=range/start=] prior to changing the
          selection if the <a>selection</a> was previously <a>empty</a> or the
          previously associated range was [=range/collapsed=].
        </p>
        <p>
          If the event is canceled, the user agent must not change the
          <a>selection</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user agent must not <a>fire an event</a> when the user agent sets
          the <a>selection</a> <a>empty</a>.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>
          <code><dfn>selectionchange</dfn></code> event
        </h3>
        <p>
          When the <a>selection</a> is dissociated with its <a>range</a>,
          associated with a new <a>range</a> or the associated <a>range</a>'s
          <a>boundary point</a> is mutated either by the user or the content
          script, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire an
          event</a> with the name <code>selectionchange</code>, which does not
          bubble and is not cancelable, at the <a>document</a> associated with
          the <a>selection</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an [^input^] or [^textarea^] element provide a text selection
          and its selection changes (in either extent or [=direction=]), the
          user agent must [=queue a task=] to [=fire an event=] with the name
          <code>selectionchange</code>, which does bubble but is not
          cancelable, at the element.
